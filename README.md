About the game
==============
The game is a 2D turn-based strategy game where all players play against all others. Every evening, a game takes place.
Each player is assigned some creatures on the 2D map, which they can move around. Creatures can attack enemy creatures.
Each creature attacked loses health points until it dies. The last player to remain alive wins.
